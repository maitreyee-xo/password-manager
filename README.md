# About the project

The following .py file contains code to a password manager application which lets a user to input website name, email/username and password of their choice and later save it to a text file (passworddata.txt). This simple and easy-to-use GUI based application helps a user to set strong passwords and save them a lot of trouble by not having to remember every password at the time of logging in.

# Highlights

- user also has an option to generate a password using a combination of symbols, numbers and lowercase and uppercase letters, so that they can have a strong password.
- after clicking the add button, once the data is saved to the text file, a confirmation message pops up which tells the user that their data has been successfully secured.
- a warning is displayed everytime one or more fields are left blank/ empty so as to make the user experience better and avoid data inconsistency.
- after the add button is clicked and all the data that a user has inputted is saved to a text file, all the fields are again set to blank.
